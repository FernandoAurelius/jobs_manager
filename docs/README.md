# Project Documentation: Morris Sheetmetal Works Workflow Management System

## **Project Overview**

Morris Sheetmetal Works is a small jobbing shop specializing in custom metal fabrication for a variety of customer needs, ranging from fencepost covers to manhole covers. The goal of this project is to transition the company from a paper-based workflow to a fully digital system, improving efficiency and enabling better oversight while maintaining or increasing operational speed.

### **Current State**

- **Established Workflow**: Running on paper systems for over 50 years.
    - Jobs tracked on paper sheets.
    - Staff time recorded on paper time cards.
- **Operational Challenges**:
    - Tracking profitability is difficult with the current system.
    - Oversight is limited without digital tools.

### **Motivations for Digitization**

1. **Enhanced Oversight**:
    - Track profitability for each job and staff member.
    - Analyze efficiency and identify problem areas.
2. **Operational Efficiency**:
    - Ensure jobs are delivered on time and correctly.
    - Streamline data entry and minimize errors.
    - Standardize processes to reduce training requirements.
3. **Future Scalability**:
    - Enable features like a CRM, purchase orders, and customer-facing tools.
    - Archive past jobs for easier retrieval and repeatability.

    - Print job sheets with all necessary information for workers.
2. **Quoting & Estimation**:
    - Fast generation of quotes while on the phone with customers.
    - Link quotes directly to jobs and invoices.
3. **Time Tracking**:
    - Digitize staff time card entries for real-time tracking.
    - Allocate hours to specific jobs and adjust as needed.
    - Monitor progress against job estimates.
4. **Materials Tracking**:

    - Support markup on materials for profitability.
5. **Billing & Payroll**:
    - Generate invoices upon job completion.
    - Ensure staff hours are accurately recorded for payroll.

### **Operational Safeguards**

- Keep data entry as fast and intuitive as flipping through paper records.

### **Analytics & Oversight**

- Job-level profitability analysis.
- Efficiency tracking for individual staff members.
- Insights into quoting accuracy (e.g., time spent quoting jobs that donâ€™t materialize).
