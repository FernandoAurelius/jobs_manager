## üêõ Bugs

- **Ugliness on job entry**: The word 'Revenue' isn't printed

- **Markup not working**: Jobs currently don't have markup functioning properly.  This means the link doesn't come up, or the client name
- **JobPricing not fully justified**: You can see the trash cans are not vertically aligned.
- **Autosave successful on failure**: You should only say successful if it passes
- **Duplicate time entries**: Not quite sure what's happening but I've seen multiple identical rows.  Probably relates to timesheet entry
- **Mins/item broke.**:  Estimate no longer saving it


## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap (Must-Have Features)

- **Suggested fix for markup**: Create a new 'markup' section to handle job markup properly. Example, time is normally marked up 30% while materials are normally marked up 20%.  This markup is **I think** a special TimeEntry, MaterialEntry, AdjustmentEntry, and it should be SHOWN in the table but should not be editable.
- **Copy estimate to quote**: Not yet implemented.
- **Revise quote**: Not yet implemented.
- **Submit quote to client**: Not yet implemented.
- **Check job as 'all fields complete'**: Feature not yet implemented.
- **Reporting: start with P&L**. Started.  Not working
- **Need to export timesheets for IMS**. Not yet implemented
- **Kanban should say job x of y**. Not yet implemented.
- **Create invoices in Xero**. Not yet implemented.
- **Timesheet week overview**. Not yet implemented.
- **Adding drawings to jobs**. Not yet implemented.  Need to tie into files (Dropbox) and to images (Google Photos)

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Nice-to-Have Ideas)

- **Look up contacts on a client**: Not implemented. Do we care enough to prioritize this feature?
- **Tie in Google Maps** Improve the client data.  Add place_id for dedupe, and look up industry 
- **Phone Calls** Tie into phone calls 
- **SMS** Useful? 
- **Email** If this becomes the place we do everything, then it's easier to get all emails
