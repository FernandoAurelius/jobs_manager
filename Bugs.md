## üêõ Bugs

- **Add client crashes during the sync to Xero**.
- **MaterialEntry creation**: Invalid field name(s) for model `MaterialEntry`: `'comments', 'item_code', 'markup', 'rate', 'total'`.
- **Kanban board bug**: Error fetching quoting jobs ‚Äì `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')`.
- **Markup not working**: Jobs currently don't have markup functioning properly.  This means the link doesn't come up, or the client name

## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap (Must-Have Features)

- **Suggested fix for markup**: Create a new 'markup' section to handle job markup properly.
- **Copy estimate to quote**: Not yet implemented.
- **Revise quote**: Not yet implemented.
- **Submit quote to client**: Not yet implemented.
- **Check job as 'all fields complete'**: Feature not yet implemented.
- **Need to handle timesheet entry**.
- **Reporting: start with P&L**.
- **Need to export timesheets for IMS**.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Nice-to-Have Ideas)

- **Jobs don't support attachments**: Suggested fix ‚Äì integrate with Dropbox or Google Drive for attachment support.
- **Look up contacts on a client**: Not implemented. Do we care enough to prioritize this feature?

## ‚ùì Uncertainties/Decisions

- **Many-to-one reverse relationship between jobs and pricing**: This isn't exactly a bug, but I'm not convinced this relationship is optimal.
- **Look up contacts on a client**: Not implemented. Do we care enough?
- **Solve the problem of shop jobs.  How do we easily say what particular shop job someone was working on.
